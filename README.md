# Survey of Analytical Methods

This repository contains the examples and resources from the Survey of Analytical Methods class offered the CANA Foundation in September 2020. The class introduces the current analytics environment, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods. Skill focus sessions throughout the class provide an opportunity to explore new methods using Excel and SIPMath, with alternate implementations of these analytics vignettes provided in the statistical programming language R or Python.
